## Why SimpleAIChat?

Most LLMs today â€” whether GPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral â€” are accessed through hosted web interfaces that abstract away the details of message formatting, memory control, and backend behavior.

Thatâ€™s convenient â€” but not always ideal.

**SimpleAIChat** is a lightweight, local-first chat client for people who want more control, transparency, or minimalism in how they interact with large language models. It supports multiple backends and aims to provide a clean, editable space to experiment, prototype, or just talk to your favorite models on your own terms.

## Design Philosophy

- LLM is treated as a stateless engine by default, with all memory and personalization stored and editable on the PC.
- Minimize UI friction: no login, no telemetry, no branding â€” just your models and your prompts.
- Make it easy to extend, customize, and connect to other tools.

## Roadmap / Ideas

- External memory (e.g. user profiles, emotional context, long-term preferences)
- Prompt scaffolding and message structuring tools
- Message history visualization and editing

## Contributing / Feedback

This project started as a personal tool to get closer to how LLMs really behave â€” without the UI layers getting in the way.

If youâ€™ve ever wished for a simpler, more direct way to interact with your preferred models, give it a try.  
Pull requests and ideas are welcome!
